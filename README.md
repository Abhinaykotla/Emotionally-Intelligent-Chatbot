# Emotionally Intelligent Chatbot Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a chatbot with emotional intelligence, capable of understanding and responding to user emotions. The chatbot will be designed to detect the emotional tone of a conversation and adapt its responses to create a more empathetic interaction. The project will involve multiple phases, from building a basic chatbot to implementing emotion detection and, optionally, multimodal capabilities.

## Project Roadmap

### **Phase 1: Research & Planning**

1. **Objective Setting**
   - Define the scope of the chatbot (basic emotions or nuanced tones).
   - Select the conversation contexts it will support (e.g., customer support, mental health).

2. **Literature Review on Emotion Detection in NLP**
   - Study current research on emotion detection, sentiment analysis, and emotionally intelligent chatbots.
   - Resources:
     - Research papers: [BERT for Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05415)
     - Books: *"Deep Learning for NLP"* by Palash Goyal, et al.

### **Phase 2: Baseline Chatbot Development**

1. **Basic NLP Chatbot Setup**
   - Create a basic chatbot using a pre-trained language model (e.g., GPT-3 or BERT).
   - Implement intent recognition, entity extraction, and response generation.

2. **Emotion Detection Model**
   - Start with sentiment analysis to classify text (positive, negative, neutral).
   - Integrate a more advanced emotion detection model to classify emotions like joy, sadness, anger, etc.

     - Datasets: [Emotion Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ishantjuyal/emotion-detection-in-text)
     - Tutorials: [Hugging Face Sentiment Analysis](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/tasks/sentiment_classification)

### **Phase 3: Integrate Emotional Responses**

1. **Emotion-Based Response Generation**
   - Map detected emotions to response tones.
   - Create a response generator to adjust its language and tone according to the detected emotion.
   - Resources:
     - Transformers Fine-Tuning: [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/)
     - Guides: [Conditional Generation with GPT](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-your-own-text-generation-model-1d24e10c4f9b)

---

### **Phase 4: Implement Multimodal Capabilities (Optional)**

1. **Voice Tone Analysis**
   - Analyze tone from user audio input for a richer emotional context.

2. **Facial Emotion Recognition**
   - Use a vision model to detect emotions from facial expressions in video input.

- Resources:
  - Audio Processing: [Librosa Library](https://librosa.org/)
  - Facial Emotion Detection: OpenCV and pre-trained emotion models.

---

### **Phase 5: Evaluation & Refinement**

1. **User Testing**
   - Conduct user testing to evaluate the chatbot's ability to detect and respond to emotions accurately.
   - Gather user feedback on the chatbotâ€™s emotional intelligence and interaction quality.

2. **Model Fine-Tuning**
   - Use feedback and test data to fine-tune the model, focusing on edge cases.
   - Implement a feedback loop to continually improve emotion detection and response generation.
